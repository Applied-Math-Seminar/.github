# Applied Mathematics Seminar 📚

Welcome to the **Applied Mathematics Seminar** repository! This space is dedicated to the exploration and discussion of various topics within the field of applied mathematics. 
Whether you’re interested in the theoretical underpinnings or the practical applications of mathematical concepts, this seminar covers it all.

## What We Do 🧮

In our seminar, we’ve already covered a wide range of fascinating topics in applied mathematics, including:

1. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE)
2. Optimal Transport
3. Inverse Problems
4. Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DFEM)
5. Stochastic Control, Optimal Control
6. etc.
   
Looking ahead, we are excited to dive into various theoretical and applied aspects of Deep Learning. 
From understanding the foundational theories to exploring its real-world applications, we’ll discuss the latest advancements in this rapidly evolving field.
